Constructive criticism to me is giving a person clear and honest feedback about something (especially if it is a bit negative), which involves pointers and corrections on what would have made it better. 
An example may be when somebody is late frequently you could say, "I have noticed that sometimes you are late and sometimes you are punctual. I believe it would help a lot if you would improve on your time management skills and also communication skills when you're late if the situation is unavoidable. "
